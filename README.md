# Reinforcement Learning Projects
This repository contains many classical applications of Reinforcement Learning (model based and model free) which have been implemented during my learning phase:
<br>
<h2>1. Maze Problem</h2> 

This is a nxn grid where each cell can have boundaries on all of it sides. The agent will find an optimal way to a terminal/goal state providede by the user. This is an application of deterministic model based RL. 

<h2>2. Frozen Lake Problem</h2>
This is quite similar to the maze problem with the difference that here, some cells have to be skipped since they have holes. An agent will have to find its way through the Frozen Lake. This is also an application of deterministic model based RL.
